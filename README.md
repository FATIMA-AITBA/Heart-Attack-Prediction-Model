🫀 Heart Attack Prediction Project
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on various medical parameters.By analyzing patient data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, the model can assist in early detection and prevention of heart-related issues.

🔍 Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Serum cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression

Number of major vessels

Thalassemia, etc.

Dataset Source: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset

💡 Objective
To provide an accurate and interpretable model that helps in identifying individuals at high risk of a heart attack, enabling timely medical intervention.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn,scipy.stats,

Matplotlib, Seaborn
